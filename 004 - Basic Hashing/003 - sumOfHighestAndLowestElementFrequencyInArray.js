// SUM OF HIGHEST AND LOWEST FREQUENCY:
// =============================================

// Given an array of n integers, find the sum of the frequencies of the highest occurring number and lowest occurring number.

// Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The highest frequency is 3 (element 3), and the lowest frequency is 1 (element 1). Their sum is 3 + 1 = 4.

function sumHighestAndLowestFrequency(nums) {

}

const input = [4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7];
const result = sumHighestAndLowestFrequency(input, 5);
console.log(`Sum of Highest & Lowest Element's Frequency in Array [${input}] is ${result}`);
